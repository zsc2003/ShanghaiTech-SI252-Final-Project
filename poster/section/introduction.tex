\textbf{Diffusion models}\cite{campbell2022continuous} are generative models that learn data distributions through step-by-step denoising. While popular in image generation, they also excel at modeling complex, multimodal structures in other domains.

In this work, we explore diffusion in \textbf{offline bandit learning} from two perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Stochastic Bandit}: A discrete diffusion model generates additional trajectories from interaction logs, expanding the limited offline dataset to enhance pretraining and reduce exploration costs.

    \item \textbf{Contextual Bandit}: A diffusion model is trained to approximate the conditional reward distribution \( P(r \mid c, a) \), enabling action selection via sampling and capturing aleatoric uncertainty.
\end{itemize}
